## 2025-05-14 - Redundancy in Static Landing Pages
**Learning:** Static landing pages often have "Coming Soon" or "Roadmap" sections that can easily become outdated or redundant as the site grows. This creates cognitive load and confusion for users who see the same items in both "current" and "future" lists.
**Action:** Always cross-reference "Coming Soon" sections with existing content during UX audits to ensure they provide actual forward-looking value rather than duplicating current features.

## 2025-05-14 - Skip Link implementation in minimalist designs
**Learning:** For sites with minimal navigation, a skip-to-content link is still essential for accessibility, even if the "main content" isn't deep. It establishes a consistent pattern for power users.
**Action:** Implement skip links even on relatively short pages to maintain accessibility standards and ensure keyboard users can bypass the header/nav predictably.
